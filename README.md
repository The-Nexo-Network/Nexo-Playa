Nexo
====

Right now nothing has been decided since the group is yet to form, but in the [wiki](https://github.com/dennisvdheijden/The-Nexo-Network/wiki/The-Nexo-Network) I (Dennis) I collect my thoughts and suggestions, while it's all coming together. I have an idea how it would be able to start. See my step by step plan of action.

## Step 1 - Network of Trust
Find a diverse group of people that are or have been taking public action towards the improvement of peoples lives. These people will live in Playa del Carmen and would like to make faster change in their own lives as well in the community. These people would be the first contributors to [The Nexo Network](https://github.com/dennisvdheijden/The-Nexo-Network/wiki/The-Nexo-Network).

## Step 2 - Empower the Contributors
Before structuring any organization it would be great with we can setup some basic projects that would eventually fall under [Nexo Services] (https://github.com/dennisvdheijden/The-Nexo-Network/wiki/The-Nexo-Network). Empower these contributors to setup their service business and experiment with voting power by concencus and arranging money flow in the most simplest way possible.

## Step 3 - From Contrubutors to Members
When the first service businesses and projects are setup and running and there is a monthly contribution to "The Nexo Fund" that is going in the direction of 10,000 pesos we should start formalizing the structure. Contributors should become members and people should really get to know and trust each-other so maybe a long weekend together to set a base of trust and circling around by peoples homes to get a feeling of who a person really is, might be a good start. Since we will go very personal in step 4. Better get to know each-other well.

## Step 4 - Members with a Vision
Setting the core vision for Nexo (if we even call it like that in the future) is up to the members to decide. Values and goals for this year should be set and the initial money collected should go to the legal and administrative team to setup our first corporation in the Nexo Network.

## Step 5 - Spreading the Word
In this stage I suggest we will go and look for contributors that donate their 800 pesos in the Development Fund and apply their co.Budget (just by Loomio discussion) to new projects or services their think should be developed. We share and document the steps and hopefully we can show initial positive results from making descisions together and sharing budget if we worked for the money ourselves.

#Step 6 - Starting New Projects
Now there is an initial structure where money is send and maybe some initial signs of good accounting and legal practices and people trust the money flows well and transparent in the organization. Now it's time to start new projects, pitching and crowdfunding among existing members and contributors. I know awesome projects will be introduced since so many people have passion for things that I might not even see now..

Step 7 - Projects Make Revenue and Fund-the-Development-Fund
Awesome some of the projects we created are generating revenue and we are concurring our first issues in the group with debates and discussions in an open an friendly spirit but with fire and passion defending our vision and dreams. This first new revenue streams come into the fund and it's time to pay someone some sort of salary to keep track of the money. Maybe we should vote on a fixed percentage that the Development Fund keeps of all money to run it's operations but we will decide on that in concensus when it's time.

Step 8 - We now start more and more projects and more people join
Time to spread the word to outside our community since we have gotten over our initial growth problems and now have a network of companies making positive changes to our community. Network members don't feel alone, feel passion, feel drive and maybe now we can start tackling the biggest issues in our community and personal lives.

Step 9 - Payments Within the Network
We have gotten pretty much all basic infrastructure done in our community and it might be a great time to let the money flow more easier between the initiatives. Why pay for food (that we produce and buy in bulk) with cash when I have money in my personal account inside [the Fund](https://github.com/dennisvdheijden/The-Nexo-Network/wiki/The-Nexo-Network). Maybe we can come up with more intelligent ways to deal with that.

Step 10 - Yeah its working!
Hundreds of people are now part of the local network and escaped their day-jobs and traded them in for more flexibel work at one or multiple projects inside The Nexo Network. Now live happy or do this all over again on another spot, now we have documented the road and learnings. We made change happen in such a short period, it can be copied everywhere. Here is the manual.
